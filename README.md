# ClawScan

**ClawScan** is a static-analysis security scanner for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) skill packages. It detects malicious patterns inspired by the real-world **ClawHavoc** supply chain attack (early 2026), in which over 1,100 trojanized skills were uploaded to the ClawHub marketplace and installed by thousands of users.

> Built as a cybersecurity portfolio project demonstrating AI agent supply chain security, mapped to **OWASP Agentic Security Initiative (ASI) Top 10** and **MITRE ATLAS**.

## What It Detects

| Detector | What It Finds | OWASP ASI |
|---|---|---|
| **Prompt Injection** | Role hijacking, instruction overrides, invisible Unicode characters | ASI01 |
| **Credential Theft** | Instructions to read/exfiltrate API keys, config files, tokens | ASI02 |
| **Exfiltration** | Reverse shells, suspicious domains, curl/wget POST patterns | ASI05 |
| **Obfuscation** | Base64 payloads, eval(), hex strings, string splitting | ASI03 |
| **Excessive Permissions** | Dangerous permission combinations in manifests | ASI06 |
| **Typosquatting** | Levenshtein-distance matching against 25 popular skills | ASI03 |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Scan a single skill directory
python scanner.py tests/malicious_samples/fake-calendar-sync --verbose

# Scan an entire skill registry (each subdirectory = one skill)
python scanner.py tests/malicious_samples --all --verbose --only-flagged

# Export results as JSON
python scanner.py tests/malicious_samples --all --json report.json
```
## Scan skills you download from ClawHub:

```bash
python scanner.py ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills --all --verbose
```
## Scan OpenClaw's built-in bundled skills:

```bash
python scanner.py ~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills --all --verbose
```

## Threat Model

ClawScan's detection rules are derived from the following sources:

- [ClawHavoc Supply Chain Attack Report](https://openclawconsult.com/lab/openclaw-clawhavoc-supply-chain)
- [Adversa AI — OpenClaw Threat Model](https://adversa.ai/blog/openclaw-ai-agent-security-threats-mapped-owasp-mitre/)
- [OWASP Agentic Security Initiative Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-agentic-security/)
- [MITRE ATLAS](https://atlas.mitre.org/)

## Risk Scoring

Each finding contributes to a cumulative risk score:

| Severity | Score |
|---|---|
| CRITICAL | 10 |
| HIGH | 7 |
| MEDIUM | 4 |
| LOW | 1 |
| INFO | 0 |

Final risk label: `CLEAN` (0) · `LOW` (1–4) · `MEDIUM` (5–10) · `HIGH` (11–20) · `CRITICAL` (>20)

---

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | All scanned skills are clean |
| 1 | One or more skills have findings |
| 2 | One or more skills have CRITICAL findings |

This makes ClawScan suitable for use in CI/CD pipelines to gate skill installations.

---

## Limitations

- Static analysis only — does not execute skills or perform dynamic analysis
- Regex-based detection can produce false positives; findings should be reviewed manually
- Typosquatting detection is limited to the 25 most-downloaded skills; extend `KNOWN_GOOD_SKILLS` in `detectors/typosquatting.py` as needed
